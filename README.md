## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
3. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

## Week 1

In the slides, there are links to RMIT resources and you will also see a breakdown of the weeks on what we will cover. The recording on Collaborate Ultra missed a lot of the audio but it might still be worth checking if you missed the class.

We went through a [list of expectations everyone has for the class](expectations.md) and we will revisit this list at the end of the semester.

In class we created a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and did the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). We then created a GitHub repository called `digital-writing-folio` added two files, `readings.md` and `exercises.md`. In `exercises.md` we answered the questions:

- What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

You should return to the last two questions throughout the semester as you use new tools in your writing practice and as you think about your final project. The selection should be finalised with me by the end of class Week 2.

The `readings.md` file you should use to keep notes on your readings of the essays/chapters in the reading list and any works of electronic literature you read.

We also discussed the differences between print and electronic literature in regards to "Taroko Gorge" and "Shade".

### Week 1 Resources

- [Week 1 slides](https://slides.com/benjaminlaird/digital-writing-week-1-2022)
- [Week 1 exercises](exercises/week1.md)

## Before Week 2

Look at the works in the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/) and read at least 3 that you find interesting (make sure to note the works you look at in your digital writing folio). You will have to pick one of these works for your Individual Case Study to present on in week 4. The selection should be finalised with me by the end of class Week 2.

## Week 2

We answered the questions:

- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?
