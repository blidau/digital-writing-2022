## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
3. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

## Week 1

In the slides, there are links to RMIT resources and you will also see a breakdown of the weeks on what we will cover. The recording on Collaborate Ultra missed a lot of the audio but it might still be worth checking if you missed the class.

We went through a [list of expectations everyone has for the class](expectations.md) and we will revisit this list at the end of the semester.

In class we created a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and did the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). We then created a GitHub repository called `digital-writing-folio` added two files, `readings.md` and `exercises.md`. In `exercises.md` we answered the questions:

- What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

You should return to the last two questions throughout the semester as you use new tools in your writing practice and as you think about your final project. The selection should be finalised with me by the end of class Week 2.

The `readings.md` file you should use to keep notes on your readings of the essays/chapters in the reading list and any works of electronic literature you read.

We also discussed the differences between print and electronic literature in regards to "Taroko Gorge" and "Shade".

### Week 1 Resources

- [Week 1 slides](https://slides.com/benjaminlaird/digital-writing-week-1-2022)
- [Week 1 exercises](exercises/week1.md)

## Before Week 2

Look at the works in the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/) and read at least 3 that you find interesting (make sure to note the works you look at in your digital writing folio). You will have to pick one of these works for your Individual Case Study to present on in week 4. The selection should be finalised with me by the end of class Week 2.

## Week 2

Both classes were streamed with Collaborate Ultra and the recordings are avaiable on Canvas. If you missed the class make sure you watch the recordings and go through the [slides and exercises](#week-2-resources).

We started off by discussing the Digital Writing Folio and the Individual Case Study. Make sure you're keeping your folio up to date. If you're having any issues with it come and see me in class as it is better to get it right early rather than leaving it until later in the semester.

For the Individual Case Study, you should have already picked the work you want to present on. If you have not, you need to select a work from the Electronic Literature Collection and send your selection to me. Make sure not to select [a work that has already been chosen](#individual-case-studies).

In the class, we answered the questions:

- How is electronic literature different from print literature?
- What are some of the qualities of electronic literature?

The answers to these questions should be recorded in your folio. For your Individual Case Study you should apply the answers to these questions to the work that you have chosen and ensure you analyse it as a work of electronic literature (recognising the literary qualities and the qualities that the digital brings).

We then discussed how algorithms and constraints have been used in print literature and digital poetry. We looked at:

- Tristan Tzara, [To Make a Dadaist Poem (1920)](https://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/tzara.html)
- Oulipo (1960â€“), N+7, Lipograms
- John Cage, Mesostics
- Jas Duke, "Fortran Two Love Song" (1966)
- John Tranter, Different Hands (1998)
- Google as a Method
- N-grams, [jGnoetry](http://www.eddeaddad.net/jGnoetry/)
- [InferKit](https://app.inferkit.com/demo)

Next we used Tristan Tzara's To Make a Dadaist Poem as a method by remixing that process on Glitch. The instructions are with the exercises but as it is initially a little complicated, watch the class video on Canvas for the specific instructions.

Finally, everyone was given a remix of Taroko Gorge and asked to answer the following questions and record the answers in their folio:

- What aspects of the remix are the same?
- What aspects of the remix are different?
- Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

If you missed the class, select any of the remixes and try and answer those questions.

### Week 2 Resources

- [Week 2 slides](https://slides.com/benjaminlaird/digital-writing-week-2-2022)
- [Week 2 exercises](exercises/week2.md)

## Week 3

No class this week due to the Labour Day public holiday but you should be working on your Individual Case Study which is due week 4

## Before Week 4

Prepare your Individual Case Study that is due and should be presented during the 11:30 class.

## Week 4

This week was mostly taken up with presentations. At the end of the second class we remixed "We Walk to You" and this part of the class was recorded with Collaborate Ultra. If you missed the class watch the video and try and create your own remix.
### Week 4 Resources

- [Week 4 slides](https://slides.com/benjaminlaird/digital-writing-week-4-2022)
- [Week 4 exercises](exercises/week4.md)

## Before Week 5

Make sure to submit your slides from your presentation to Canvas.

## Week 5

The class recording is on Collaborate Ultra, but there might be some issues with the screen sharing so if there is anything missed in the video which isn't in the slides or exercises let me know, and I'll update the supporting documentation.

We started the class by going over HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each can be broadly thought of as addressing different aspects of how a webpage comes together:

- Structural: HTML
- Presentational: CSS
- Behavioural: JavaScript

We then moved on to [making a simple website](exercises/week5.md#create-a-simple-website). We skipped over [turning the folio into a GitHub pages site](exercises/week5.md#folio-as-a-github-pages-website), but feel free to do this if you want.

We looked at literary print precursors to digital hypertext fiction, the technical precursors to hypertext fiction, and hypertext fiction itself. Following on we discussed the differences between digital hypertext fiction and fiction, and between digital hypertext fiction and games. And we also talked about how we plan print fiction and how we might plan (or not plan) hypertext fiction.

For the rest class we worked on [writing a short hypertext narrative with Twine](exercises/week5.md#create-and-publish-a-twine-story), and we used GitHub and Netlify to publish the story so that it was publicly available.

A Discord server has been set up for class discussions/questions and a joining link has been emailed to everyone. If the link expires before you manage to join let me know, and I'll send you another.

## Week 6

The class recording is on Collaborate Ultra, but there might be some issues with the screen sharing so if there is anything missed in the video which isn't in the slides or exercises let me know, and I'll update the supporting documentation.

I started the class going through some general feedback for the presentations. The quality of the presentations was excellent, but there were a few common things to watch (especially for the proposal presentations). Ensure the right amount of text on your slides, you want enough to orient the audience, so they know the key points you are talking to but not too much so that you are just reading the slides. Finally, make sure you structure your presentation to the time limit. 

We discussed the proposals for the major creative work next. The proposals are due in week 7 so read the class handbook for what is required (for the proposal and the supporting documentation). The prototype should show how your piece will perform as a work of electronic literature but does not need to be a digital work. Your prototype can be a pen-and-paper prototype. However, you may find that if your final work will be produced with Twine then you will be able to quickly produce a prototype with Twine.

I then showed how to [change the styles in a Twine story](exercises/week6.md#change-the-story-styles). If you intend to use Twine make sure you complete the exercise. We also went through [how to add a linked image in Twine](exercises/week6.md#adding-a-linked-image).

This week I discussed parser-based interactive fiction and the differences between parser and choice-based works. Following that we looked at the [Tiny Tools Directory](https://tinytools.directory/) for possible alternative tools in which to make your work and I went through two more exercises: [creating a story in Inform 7 (software for creating parser-based works)](exercises/week6.md#create-an-inform-7-story) and [creating a game in Bitsy](exercises/week6.md#create-a-bitsy-game).

### Week 6 Resources

- [Week 6 exercises](exercises/week6.md)

## Before Week 7

You should be working on your proposals for your major creative work which is due in class in week 7. Make sure to have emailed me your slides before the 11:30 class. Both classes will be taken up with the presentations.

## Week 7

Proposals are due in class today. After the class make sure to submit your slides and any supporting documentation to Canvas.

Also, send me or post on Discord any technical questions / problems, and we will create a list in class.

## Week 9

The class recording for the first class is on Collaborate Ultra. It looks like it captured everything but if there is an issue with the recording, let me know and I'll update the class repository with anything that was missed.

This week we covered the differences between games and digital literature (and how they overlap). We discussed how a game is readâ€”and for what qualitiesâ€”versus how a piece of literature is read.

We also looked at and discussed web and game accessibility. There are links to accessibility resources in the slides.

I went through a couple of audio exercises: [adding simple audio in Twine](exercises/week9.md#add-audio-to-a-twine-story) and [a remix using `howler.js`, a JavaScript audio library](exercises/week9.md#audio-example-with-howlerjs).

I proposed that we dedicate week 11 to workshopping, and I will set up some timeslots of 10 minutes each for me to give you feedback on your projects in that week.

At the start of the second class, I spoke briefly about what is required for the digital writing folios. These requirements are in the course handbook, but the exact format of submission still needs to be finalised.

In week 10, I will be addressing images (background images, image layouts and image animations), and for the rest of the class you will have time to work on your projects.
