# Week 6

## Twine

### Change the Story Styles

1. In the bottom right of Twine click the title of your story to reveal the menu.
2. Select "Edit Story Stylesheet".
3. Add styles for the story, links and change the font.

Example styles:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Homemade+Apple&display=swap');

tw-story {
  font-family: 'Homemade Apple', cursive;
  color: #FFF;
  background-color: #000;  
}

.story-image {
  width: 100%;
}

tw-link, tw-link:link, tw-link:visited, tw-link.visited {
  color: #FFF;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
tw-link:focus, tw-link:hover, tw-link:active, tw-link.visited:hover {
  color: #FFF;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

### Adding a Linked Image

1. [Add an image to the passage as shown in the week 5 exercise](week5.md#add-an-image-to-a-passage)
   ```html
   <img class="story-image" src="./images/example.jpg" alt="an example" />
   ```
2. Treat the image HTML the same as link text in a Harlowe link. So if the passage you are linking to is called "Another room", in your passage you would have:
   ```html
   [[<img class="story-image" src="./images/example.jpg" alt="an example" />->Another room]]
   ```
