# Week 9

## Add Audio to a Twine Story

1. Create an `audio` folder/directory in the same folder/directory as the `index.html`.
2. Add the sound file for your Twine story to that folder/directory.
3. In your Twine story add an audio element with a relative reference to your sound file. So if your sound file is called `example.mp3` add the following audio element:
   ```html
   <audio src="./audio/example.mp3" autoplay loop />
   ```
