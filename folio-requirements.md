# Folio Requirements

The folio demonstrates your experimentation and engagement with the form during the class. It needs to address the criteria as outlined in the class handbook:

1. Reflective thinking - Reflection on own practice; Reflection on community of practice; Engagement with the work of your peers
2. Form and structure - Experiment with different forms; Demonstrate innovative intentions within forms
3. Style and expression - Clear written expression; Appropriateness of expression; Aesthetic aptitude
4. Professional and academic standard - Spelling, grammar and punctuation; Clarity of layout

Ensure that you read the [digital writing folio assessment description in the course handbook](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/95328/pages/class-handbook-digital-writing).

Try and capture as much as you can in your folio. If you had a few iterations of your final project or experimented with techniques you did not use in your final piece; the folio is the place to record this with reflections and/or links to the experiments.

For the submission to Canvas, the document should include:

- Your name
- An artist statement (if this is already included in an artist CV or your website, still have it here, but it can be the same).
- A 500-word reflection on the class and how your practice has developed (if this is included in your GitHub digital writing folio, still have it here too).
- An artist CV or a link to a website that conveys similar information (e.g. artist bio and publications).
- A link to your GitHub account and your digital writing folio GitHub repository. Your folio repository should have links to your digital experiments and short reflections on those experiments.
- Additional pages to your submission document, which include your reflections on your community of practice and experiences workshopping your creative project if these are not included in your folio repository.
